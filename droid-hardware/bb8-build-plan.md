# BB-8 Exocortex Droid — Modern Build Plan
**Version:** 1.0  
**Architect:** Orin 🖖 + Will  
**Date:** 2026-03-20  
**Reference:** Instructables 3D Printed BB-8 (hamster-drive design)  
**Focus:** Thermal management, inference-while-moving, fully offline

---

## Design Philosophy

This is not a toy. This is a personal Exocortex in BB-8 form factor — running local inference on 3 Raspberry Pis submerged in mineral oil inside a 3D-printed sphere. No internet required. No cloud. The droid thinks, moves, speaks, listens, and remembers — on its own.

**Key constraints:**
1. All compute on-device (no WiFi/internet dependency)
2. Thermal management for sustained inference while moving
3. Oil slosh management inside a rolling sphere
4. 3+ hour battery life at booth duty cycle
5. Printable on a consumer 3D printer (Ender 3 / Prusa i3 build volume)

## Sphere Design

### Dimensions
- **Outer diameter:** 300mm (12 inches) — large enough for all components, small enough to 3D print in hemispheres
- **Shell thickness:** 3mm (PETG for impact resistance)
- **Print method:** Split into upper hemisphere + lower hemisphere + equatorial ring
- **Join method:** M3 bolts at equator ring (16 points) + gasket for oil-chamber seal

### Printing
- **Material:** PETG (not PLA — PLA warps at high temps, PETG handles 80°C)
- **Infill:** 20% gyroid (strength with minimal weight)
- **Layer height:** 0.2mm (quality vs speed balance)
- **Print time per hemisphere:** ~18-24h on Ender 3 (300mm is close to max build volume)
- **If build plate too small:** split each hemisphere into 4 segments, join with epoxy + fiberglass tape

### Surface Finish
- Sand to 400 grit → XTC-3D epoxy coating → primer → BB-8 orange/white paint scheme
- Alternative: vinyl wrap (faster, removable)

---

## Oil Chamber (sealed, baffled)

### Construction
- **Container:** 3D-printed rectangular box, sealed with silicone gasket
- **Internal dimensions:** 130 × 100 × 120mm (fits 3-Pi stack)
- **Volume:** ~1.5L (includes baffle volume)
- **Material:** PETG, 2mm walls, filleted corners
- **Seal:** silicone O-ring at lid, M3 bolts with nylon washers

### Baffle System (anti-slosh)
The sphere rolls. Oil sloshes. Slosh shifts the center of gravity unpredictably, destabilizing the carriage.

**Solution: perforated baffle plates**
```
┌─────────────────────┐
│  ┌─┐ ┌─┐ ┌─┐ ┌─┐  │  ← baffle plate (perforated)
│  │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │  │     oil flows through holes slowly
│  └─┘ └─┘ └─┘ └─┘  │     slosh energy absorbed
│  ══════════════════ │  ← Pi board (component acts as baffle too)
│  ┌─┐ ┌─┐ ┌─┐ ┌─┐  │  ← second baffle
│  │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │  │
│  └─┘ └─┘ └─┘ └─┘  │
│  ══════════════════ │  ← Pi board
│  ┌─┐ ┌─┐ ┌─┐ ┌─┐  │  ← third baffle
│  │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │  │
│  └─┘ └─┘ └─┘ └─┘  │
│  ══════════════════ │  ← Pi board
└─────────────────────┘
```

- 3mm PETG baffle plates between each Pi
- 6mm diameter holes, 40% open area (enough flow for thermal convection, enough resistance to kill slosh)
- The Pi PCBs themselves act as partial baffles
- Total baffle count: 5 (2 between Pis + 1 top + 1 bottom + Pi PCBs)

### Oil Filling
- Fill through a port with check valve at top of chamber
- Leave 5% air gap for thermal expansion
- Food-grade mineral oil (USP grade from pharmacy)

### Thermal Performance (in-sphere)
```
Pi 5 active (12W) + 2× Pi 4 idle (5.4W) = 17.4W
Oil thermal resistance: ~1.5°C/W
Sphere interior ambient (Oshkosh, shaded by head): ~40°C

Die temperature: 40 + (17.4 × 1.5) = 66°C
Thermal headroom: 19°C below throttle ← safe
```

Aquarium pump (USB-powered, inside oil chamber):
- Forces oil circulation → reduces theta to ~1.0°C/W
- Die temp drops to: 40 + (17.4 × 1.0) = 57°C
- **23°C headroom** with pump running

---

## Drive Carriage (hamster-drive mechanism)

### Principle
The carriage sits at the bottom of the sphere, weighted so it always stays down (pendulum). Two wheels press against the inside of the sphere, driving it to roll. The sphere rotates around the carriage.

```
        ┌──── sphere shell ────┐
        │                      │
        │    ○ flywheel        │  ← yaw control
        │                      │
        │  ┌──────────────┐   │
        │  │   OIL CHAMBER│   │  ← mounted to carriage frame
        │  │   (Pi stack) │   │
        │  └──────────────┘   │
        │                      │
        │  ┌──┐  motor  ┌──┐  │
        │  │▓▓│←──────→│▓▓│  │  ← drive wheels (silicone coated)
        │  └──┘         └──┘  │
        │  ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓  │  ← counterweight (brass bar)
        └──────────────────────┘
```

### Components

| Component | Model | Specs | Price |
|---|---|---|---|
| Drive motors (×2) | JGB37-520 12V DC gear motor | 30 RPM, 10kg·cm torque | $12 ea |
| Motor driver | L298N H-bridge | Dual channel, 12V 2A per channel | $5 |
| Drive wheels (×2) | 65mm silicone wheel | High-grip, press against sphere interior | $8 pair |
| Flywheel motor | NEMA 17 stepper | Yaw torque via angular momentum | $12 |
| Flywheel disc | 3D printed, brass-weighted | 200g, 80mm diameter | $5 |
| Counterweight | Brass bar | 500g, bottom of carriage | $8 |
| IMU | MPU-6050 (GY-521) | 6-axis gyro+accelerometer | $4 |
| Casters (×2) | 15mm ball casters | Support carriage, low friction | $3 pair |

### Carriage Frame
- 3D printed PETG
- U-shaped cradle: motors at bottom, oil chamber mounted above
- Counterweight (brass) at very bottom — ensures pendulum stability
- Total carriage weight with oil chamber: ~2.2 kg
- Center of gravity: 40mm below sphere center (stability margin)

### Movement Control

**Forward/backward:** both drive motors same direction → sphere rolls  
**Turning:** differential drive → sphere turns  
**Yaw (heading change without translation):** flywheel spins → reaction torque rotates carriage relative to sphere  
**Self-righting:** counterweight ensures carriage always returns to bottom-heavy orientation

**Control loop (runs on Pi 4 mesh node):**
```
IMU reads → orientation estimate (complementary filter)
  → PID controller adjusts motor speeds
  → Flywheel adjusts heading
  → Update rate: 100Hz (10ms loop)
  → Pi 4 handles this easily (<5% CPU)
```

The Pi 5 brain is NOT involved in movement control. It only does inference. The Pi 4 (mesh node) runs the motor control loop — keeps inference latency isolated from motor jitter.

---

## Head Assembly (magnetic)

### Principle
The head rides on top of the sphere, held by magnets. Internal magnets in the carriage attract external magnets in the head through the sphere shell. As the carriage stays upright, the head stays on top.

### Components

| Component | Model | Specs | Price |
|---|---|---|---|
| Internal magnets (×4) | N52 neodymium disc | 20mm × 5mm, 12kg pull each | $10 |
| External magnets (×4) | N52 neodymium disc | 15mm × 5mm (in head base) | $8 |
| Head servo (×2) | SG90 micro servo | Pan + tilt for head expressiveness | $4 pair |
| Speaker | 3W 40mm driver | Voice output, mounted in head | $5 |
| Microphone | I2S MEMS (INMP441) | Always-on listening, directional | $4 |
| Camera | Pi Camera Module 3 | For instruction cards + visual | $25 |
| e-ink display | Waveshare 1.54" | Shows coordinate, personality emoji | $15 |
| Head IMU | BNO055 | 9-axis, tracks head-vs-body orientation | $12 |

### Head Tracking
Head servo tracks the loudest audio source (beamforming with MEMS mic) — the head "looks at" whoever is speaking. The head IMU provides feedback to maintain gaze direction even as the sphere rolls underneath.

### Head Design
- 3D printed, 100mm hemisphere
- BB-8 style "eye" lens over camera
- e-ink display visible through a small window
- Speaker fires downward (bounces off sphere for omnidirectional audio)
- Weight: ~200g total (magnets are heaviest component)

---

## Power System

### Battery
**Primary:** 4S LiPo 5000mAh (74Wh, 430g)
- Mounted low in carriage (contributes to counterweight)
- XT60 quick-disconnect for hot swap
- **Runtime at booth duty (23.6W avg):** 188 minutes (3+ hours)

### Power Distribution
```
4S LiPo (14.8V)
  ├── 12V regulator → drive motors (L298N)
  ├── 5V/5A buck converter → Pi 5 (USB-C PD)
  ├── 5V/3A buck converter → Pi 4A + Pi 4B (USB-C)
  ├── 5V/1A buck converter → servos, speaker, LEDs
  └── 12V direct → flywheel stepper driver (A4988)
```

### Battery Monitor
- INA219 current sensor on I2C (connected to Pi 4 mesh node)
- Reports: voltage, current, power, estimated remaining runtime
- Droid announces: "I have about 2 hours left" / "I need to dock soon"
- At 15% → droid rolls toward dock station autonomously
- At 5% → orderly shutdown (SQ flush to SD first)

---

## Software Architecture (fully offline)

### Boot Sequence
```
Power on → Pi 4A boots first (SQ, fastest to ready: ~15s)
  → Pi 4B boots (Tailscale attempt, Kiwix, motor control: ~20s)
  → Pi 5 boots last (Ollama model load: ~30s)
  → Droid announces: "I'm awake. [personality greeting]"
  → Motor controller initialized, IMU calibrated
  → Ready for interaction (~45s total cold boot)
```

### Process Distribution

| Process | Runs on | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Ollama (7B 4-bit inference) | Pi 5 | Needs the A76 cores + 8GB RAM |
| SQ (phext database) | Pi 4A | Always-on, low CPU, high reliability |
| Qdrant (semantic search) | Pi 4A | Shares RAM with SQ, both are I/O bound |
| Motor control loop (100Hz) | Pi 4B | Isolated from inference latency |
| Audio pipeline (mic→STT→TTS→speaker) | Pi 5 | Shares inference resources |
| Camera + OCR (instruction cards) | Pi 4B | Offloads Pi 5 brain |
| Kiwix (offline Wikipedia) | Pi 4B | Read-only, serves via HTTP |
| Health monitor + battery | Pi 4B | Lightweight, always running |

### Audio Pipeline (offline STT + TTS)
- **STT:** Whisper.cpp (tiny model, runs on Pi 5 A76 cores) — ~1s latency for 5s utterance
- **TTS:** Piper (ONNX, runs on Pi 5) — ~0.5s for sentence generation
- Total voice loop: speak → 1.5s → droid speaks back → + inference time

### Inference While Moving
The critical design decision: **motor control and inference are on separate Pis.**

If inference stalls (generating a long response), the motor loop on Pi 4B continues at 100Hz without interruption. The droid doesn't fall over while thinking.

If motors are active (rolling), inference on Pi 5 is unaffected — no shared CPU, no priority contention.

This is the multi-Pi advantage. A single-Pi design would have to time-share between inference and motor control, causing either jerky movement or slow responses.

## Thermal Management Summary

```
Heat sources:
  Pi 5 (active): 12W → hottest component
  Pi 4A (idle): 2.7W → barely warm
  Pi 4B + motor control: 3.5W → warm
  Motor controller (L298N): 2W → mounts OUTSIDE oil chamber
  Motors: heat dissipated to sphere shell directly
  
Heat removal:
  Mineral oil bath (1.5L) → absorbs + distributes
  Baffles → prevent slosh, promote convection
  Aquarium pump → forced circulation
  Sphere shell → radiates to air (large surface area: πd² = 0.28m²)
  Head gap → natural convection chimney at top
  
Worst case (Oshkosh, 95°F, pulsed inference):
  Pi 5 die: 66°C (19°C margin to 85°C throttle)
  Pi 4 dies: 54°C (comfortable)
  Oil temp: 50-55°C (warm to touch through sphere, not painful)
  
Steady state reached: ~50 minutes from cold start
```
